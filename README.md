### Building own custom news hub in Python, by aggregating RSS feeds.

### What is an RSS Feed?
RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is a web feed that allows websites to publish updates (like news, blog posts, or articles) in a standardized XML format. It enables users or applications to fetch and display the latest content automatically without manually visiting the site.

### How RSS Feeds Work:

Websites provide an RSS feed URL (usually ending in .xml or .rss).
The Python news aggregator fetches and parses this XML feed.
The extracted titles, links, descriptions, and timestamps are displayed in the custom news hub.
